        content: `LaundryLoop is a mobile app that reimagines laundry as a smart, personalized experience. It helps users manage washing, dry cleaning, and fabric care, while promoting eco-friendly habits through rewards and gamification. Designed for busy and conscious users, the app combines AI fabric detection, a smart closet, and smooth UX to make laundry feel less like a chore.`

        title: 'Problem Statement',
        content: `Laundry is a routine task, yet managing it can be surprisingly complex ‚Äî especially when juggling different services like washing, dry cleaning, and ironing. Users often face confusion around how to care for specific fabrics, leading to damaged clothes or service dissatisfaction.

There are also gaps in access to eco-conscious options in the laundry space, including green detergents and sustainability. Most apps or services focus on transactions, not experiences ‚Äî leading to missed opportunities for engagement, efficiency, and habit change.

LaundryLoop addresses this by combining utility, simplicity, fabric learning, gamification, eco nudges, and modern, sustainable decisions ‚Äî all while keeping intuitive and even enjoyable to use.`

+ One key challenge was balancing features (complexity! AI, scheduling, gamification!) with a clean and intuitive flow. I learned to prioritize clarity, modular design, and micro-interactions to keep things human.
+ The outcome was a mobile app concept that feels smart, simple, and purposeful ‚Äî addressing real pain-points while encouraging more mindful habits. This project deepened my understanding of end-to-end product design, from research and ideation to interface and systems thinking.`
